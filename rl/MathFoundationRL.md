## Basic concepts
**State**:status of agent in environment
**State space**:set of all possible states
**Action**
**Action space of a state**:set of all possible actions in a state. $A(s_i)$ is function of state
**State transition** defines interaction with the environment. could be stochastic or deterministic. 
Use state transition probability (conditional probability) to describe the state transition. $P(s_j|s_i,a_i)$
**Policy $\pi(a_i|s)$** means probability of taking action $a_i$ in state $s$
